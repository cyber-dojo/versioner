Versioner decides what kind of commit it has received...
  o) development release (SHA='cc86da6', RELEASE='')
  o) public release      (SHA='cc86da6', RELEASE='3.41.2')

Tests running _BEFORE_ images have been pushed
----------------------------------------------

4. If its a RELEASE
   All images in .env are current :latest? :beta?

5. when the git-commit message starts [RELEASE=X]
   then X has semantic form A.B.C
   then A.B.C is going forwards


Tests running _AFTER_ images have been pushed
---------------------------------------------
1. given we're on CI,
   when a commit message does _not_ signify a release (viz it does not start [RELEASE=...])
   then a dockerhub image is tagged with the 1st seven chars of the git-commit's sha
   then the image's SHA env-var matches the full git-commit sha
   then the image's RELEASE env-var is the empty string

2. given we're on CI,
   when a commit message signifies a release (viz it starts [RELEASE=A.B.C])
   then a dockerhub image is tagged with the 1st seven chars of the git-commit's sha
   then a dockerhub image is tagged with A.B.C
   then these are the same image
   then the image's SHA env-var matches the full git-commit sha
   then the image's RELEASE env-var is A.B.C
