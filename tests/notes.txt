Versioner decides whether to take the
sha of commander:latest and embed it into a .env
file that it commits to a
  o) dev release    (SHA='cc86da6', RELEASE='')
  o) public release (SHA='cc86da6', RELEASE='3.41.2')

what tests does versioner need?

1. the SHAs for all services exist as github commits.
2. the TAGs for all services exist as dockerhub images.
3. start-points stater-base validation
      the BASE_SHA env-var for custom/exercises/languages-{a,c,s}
         (extracted with a [docker run ... sh -c 'cat /app/.env'])
      matches the SHA for CYBER_DOJO_STARTER_BASE_SHA in .env
